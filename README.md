Crypto Cat
===========

Modifications to the game include :
  - Gravity of the game can flip/invert at random thus increasing its difficulty.
  - Made it even more frustating :P . 
  - Added nyan cat instead of the derpy duck.
  - Added an 8 bit soundtrack , a remix of the popular nya nya nya track.
  - Added a rainbow trail to the nyan cat.

How it adapts to the theme "The Game has changed"?

For starters I have completely changed the art/theme of the game. I've added a nyan cat instead of the flappy bird with the rainbow trail and the irritating soundrack.

Most importantly flippy cat can "change" at any moment.
The gravity of the game is set to flip at random.
